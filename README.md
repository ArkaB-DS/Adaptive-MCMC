# Adaptive-MCMC
This is a group project for the course MTH707A: Markov Chain Monte Carlo at IIT Kanpur.

### Group Memebers : 
1. Aritra Majumdar
2. Arkajyoti Bhattacharjee
3. Sanket Agrawal

### Tentative Title :

### Tentative Parts of the Project
+ Part 1 : Motivation for MCMC -two schemes
+ Part 2 : Adaptive MH - showing the two schmes
+ Part 3 (Main Part) : An adaptive Bernoulli factory MCMC with implementation in Gamma mixture of Weibulls
+ Part  4 : Theoretical Underpinnings 
  - Non-Markovian Property 
  - Sufficient Conditions for Convergence in Distribution : (Here we may use Rosenthal's Applet to show that this is really a problem - the entrapment)
      - Diminishing / Vanishing Adaptation
      - Containment / Bounded Convergence
